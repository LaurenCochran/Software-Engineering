# open source software licenses
- I would use the Apache License. I'm already familiar with this license from taking Web Development. We had to deploy an EC2 instance that use Apache.
- I would also use the MIT License because the copyright for it is very short and there aren't as many resistrictions as Apache. All you have to include is the copyright notice, which gives a lot of freedom in what you can do with the sfotware.
