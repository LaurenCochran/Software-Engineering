# Open Source Humane Society Analytics 

## About 
 This open source software looks at the outcomes of animals leaving the humane society (Austin, TX) and then compiles statistics about this information in order to help with the survival of humane socities around the U.S. By looking at this information, hopefully humane societies can learn more about what resourcese and procedures need to be implemented in their facilities in order to provide the best outcomes for the animals under their care.  

## Functionality
 Our program takes the data released from the government and uses that as a basis to obtain more specific analytics. The program first compiles a generic amount of analytics:
- Number of animals adopted
- Number of animals fostered
- Number of animals euthanized 
- Most freqent reason for euthanasia 
- Most frequently adopted animal
- How many animals had been re-adopted (look at animal ID)
- Most common breeds among the different animals
 <br>Along with these computations, our software provides a tool to be able to manipulate the data upon these factors: 
- Animal ID|
- Name
- DateTime
- MonthYear
- Date of Birth
- Outcome Type
- Animal Type
- Sex upon Outcome
- Breed
- Color
 to make a more specific analysis geared towards the user's needs. 
 
## Getting Started 
 This software can be run on any Operating System.
 
 To begin, download the the program provided. There is no login required. Once downloaded, the generic analytics should appear on the page. Click the tool icon in order to creat your own outcomes that could be displayed in:
 - a graph
 - a computational outcome
  You will need a basic understanding of databases in order to do this. If you think your specific analytic will be helpful to many, please see the Contributing heading for ways to implement that in the software. 
 
## Contributing
  To contribute, just start working on the code provided and issue a pull request for the data to be reviewed. If you are looking to create new functionality for the program, it first must be reviewed and discussed among the team, which can be brought up in a pull request, also. 
  
  We also hope to have more humane socities contributing in the future, so if you would like to provide data from your humane society please contact us, and we will add the needed data to the database.
