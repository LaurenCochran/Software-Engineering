- Over the Evolution group and their metrics
- Saw the review for a metric -- there is a waiting period in order to push requests. 
- The evolution group looked at 2 metrics that had been worked on and went section by section of the metric to see if the content made sense with what each metric was looking for. For instance, they looked at Inactive Contributors and the phrasing in the objectives was how people are losing interest in the community, but that's more of a reasoning behind being inavtive, which would be usefule to know, but that isn't what Inactive Contributors is looking for specifically. So, a comment was placed for there to be a change here, which shows the review process of looking through metrics. They also looked at Code Length similarly. It was interesting to hear the conversation around the metrics as it encompasses the idea of open source software even on metrics: a collaborative effort.
