#Zoom Session 
I want to attend the April 2 and April 9 at 11am: Augur Working Group


##Podcast Reflection 
- I really liked that one member pointed out that he didn't have his PHD. I think it just shows that anyone with applicable knowledge can contribute to open source software. It doesn't matter how much schooling you have, especially in an area where you aren't pushed to go out and get your masters or higher since a bachelors in Computer Science can take you far.
- I also liked that it made CHAOSS as a whole seem more approachable. Since CHAOSS is so data centered, hearing some of the people who contribute to it make it seem more approachable and less overwhelming. 
- As someone who has never worked on or really looked into open source software, it did show me the importance of it, especially since one of the poeple on the podcast said she used AUGUR to get the data she wanted at work.
- Also highlights the community aspect of open source software.
