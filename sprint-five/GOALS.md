# Goals
Ideally, I would like to create a world-building app; an app that you can use to plan a world for a story, for instance. There would be sections where you can make character profiles and add details about the world (just description). In the long run, I think it would be nice to have a visual representation of what things could look like, but I think that would be something to be added later down the road. The core audience would be anyone wanting to build a world -- doesn't have to be specific to people writing books, but it mainly would be marketed towards authors. This app would be collecting the data that the users are entering to save their world and tie it to their specific account they have on the site.
