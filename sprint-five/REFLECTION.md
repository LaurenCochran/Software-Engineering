### What worked
- Following the instructions on Github was really easy
- The website provided was also helpful when going back through, especially for the Google authentication part
### What Didn't Work
- I didn't connect it with the dex example. I wasn't too sure if we had to or not. It seemed like in the slack we didn't.
-Besides that, everything worked great. I think the videos and steps were helpful in making sure it was easy to follow along with.
- I also tried to rerun it and the client ID and client secrets got reset, so I don't know if that's supposed to happen or not.

### Functionality in Future
- In the future, I would like it to be connected to Facebook, since that's the default option I usually use if it's for something I don't want to really sign up for. 
- i'd also like to create a function login with it with a database. I think it would be good to learn more about the cryptography that goes into keeping username and passwords safe.
